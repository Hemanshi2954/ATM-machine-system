# ATM Machine System:

## This code simulates basic ATM functionality for educational purposes. It's not intended for real-world financial transactions due to security limitations.
## Uploading code with sensitive information like hardcoded account details is not recommended. Consider using placeholders and environment variables for security.


## Code Structure:

The code will be organized into multiple files for better readability and maintainability:

1.  atm.h: Header file containing function prototypes and declarations.
2.  atm.cpp: Implementation file for ATM functionality.
3.  account.h: Header file for the Account class definition.
4.  account.cpp: Implementation file for the Account class methods.
